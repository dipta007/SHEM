## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Code

For simplicity and usability, the code is divided into different branches based on the experiments. The `main` branch contains the information of other branches. The following table shows the branches and their corresponding experiments.

| Branch | Experiment | Section in Paper | Table in Paper | Model Name in Paper |
| :---: | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [main](https://github.com/dipta007/SHEM) | Information on All experiments | - | - | - |
| [inference_frame](https://github.com/dipta007/SHEM/tree/inference_frame) | Is Frame Inheritance Sufficient? | 5.1 | 1, 6, 7 | `ours: inf. frame` |
| [lexical](https://github.com/dipta007/SHEM/tree/lexical) | Is Frame Inheritance Sufficient? | 5.1 | 1, 6, 7 | `ours: lexical` |
| [ind_frame](https://github.com/dipta007/SHEM/tree/ind_frame) | Relations Beyond Inheritance | 5.2 | 2, 8, 9 | `Using`, `Precedes`, `Metaphor`, `See_also`, `Causative_of`, `Inchoative_of`, `Perspective_on`, `Subframe`, `ReFraming_Mapping`  |
| [grp](https://github.com/dipta007/SHEM/tree/grp) | Relations Beyond Inheritance | 5.2 | 2, 12, 13 | `grouping` |
| [scn](https://github.com/dipta007/SHEM/tree/scn) | Relations Beyond Inheritance | 5.2 | 2, 10, 11 | `scenario_only` |
| [missing_grp](https://github.com/dipta007/SHEM/tree/missing_grp) | Predicting Missing Events | 5.3 | 3 | `grp` |
